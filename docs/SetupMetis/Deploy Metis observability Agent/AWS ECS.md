# üí† AWS ECS

## Deploy to ECS using CloudFormation

Deploy the Metis agent to¬†**[Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)¬†(ECS)**¬†using CloudFormation.

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies your deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. Simply describe your application and the resources required, and Amazon ECS will launch, monitor, and scale your application across flexible compute options with automatic integrations to other supporting AWS services that your application needs.

## Using Stacks

When you use CloudFormation,¬†**you manage related resources as a single unit** called a **stack**. You create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's CloudFormation template.

## Configure and create Metis agent stack

Open Metis‚Äôs¬†**[CloudFormation Template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://metis-data-market-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/metadata-collector-cloudformation.yaml&stackName=MetisMetadataCollector)**

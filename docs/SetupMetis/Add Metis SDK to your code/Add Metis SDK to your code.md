# Add Metis SDK to your code

Integrating Metis SDK means you can analyze the SQL queries generated by your code. Run your code as usual while Metis generates distributed traces and sends them to our servers for further analysis.

Metis will combine all this information to create an E2E view of those traces and their analysis, so you will be able to gain crucial insights about your queries.

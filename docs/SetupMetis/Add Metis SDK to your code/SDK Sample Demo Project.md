# SDK Sample Demo Project

<aside>
üí° The sample demo project is a good way to quickly see the Metis SDK in action and what value it brings
This sample project works with SQLAlchemy + Flask

</aside>

Usage **overview**

1. Download the sample code repository
2. Configure a connection to the PG Server. You can use a connection string to a sample cloud DB or spin up a Docker image, that we also provide.
3. Configure a Metis API Key.
4. Run the Flask Server locally.
5. Run a REST command called ‚Äúrun_demo‚Äù. This command generates a few traces
6. Open Metis Web App to review the traces, SQL commands, and insights.

### In more d**etail**

**Step 1 - Open the code sample**

Open the project‚Äôs GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/metis-data/sdk-examples/tree/main/python/flask-sqlalchemy-example).

Download the Metis SDK for SQLAlcehmy from¬†[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemycollector/).

**Step 2 - Configure the Connection String**

The server connects to a PG database called "flights". You can connect to the databases in one of the following options:

1. Using an existing PG server connecting using a connection string
   Connection string:

```bash
postgresql://user1:password@srv1.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/flights
```

1. Using Docker image
   The image contains PG 15 with the Database.

üí° Detailed instructions on how to run the docker can be found¬†here.¬†Add link to instructions

</aside>

       Connection string:

```bash
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/flights
```

1. Download the DB yourself from [here](https://www.notion.so/Slack-community-43dbf9c61a0d45bdbf352b37c3714166?pvs=21). what is the connection string in this case

In the app.py file edit the code to use a valid connection string

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from sqlalchemycollector import setup, MetisInstrumentor, PlanCollectType
app = Flask(__name__)
with app.app_context():

    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = <CONNECTION STRING HERE>
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

    db = SQLAlchemy(app)
    migrate = Migrate(app, db)
```

**Step 3 - Metis Instrumentation**

The code uses simple instrumentation to configure: replace with edit the code to

**Metis API Key (Mandatory)**¬†- [Create a project & generate API key](../Create%20a%20project%20&%20generate%20API%20key.md)

**Service Name (Optional)**¬†- A metadata tag used to identify all the traces sent by this Flask Server.

**Service Version (Optional)**¬†- a metadata tag used for better control on the traces sent by each Flask server. For example, it can help detect problems in the new version of the service "flights"

```python
instrumentation: MetisInstrumentor = setup('flights',
                        api_key='Sc0123456789abcdefgABCDEFG',
												service_name='my demo project',
                        service_version='1.1'
                                            )

    instrumentation.instrument_app(app, db.get_engine())
```

**Step 4 - Run the Flask Server**

Run the Flask server from the terminal with the command:

```bash
./env/bin/flask run
```

**Step 5 - Call the REST Methods**

Open the browser with the IP provided by the terminal. By default it is¬†`http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

Run the REST command¬†`http://127.0.0.1:5000/run_demo`. It generates a few traces

\***\*Step 6 - View the Traces in Metis Web App\*\***

Open the Recent Activity of the project. You must use the project that is mapped to the API key you provided in Step 3.

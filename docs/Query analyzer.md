# Query Analyzer

With the query analyzer module you can analyze and get insights about your queries without integrating Metis in your application.

The query analyzer requires only a query and its executions plan in order to provide valuable insight about it.

The query analyzer uses the same Metis engine to get comprehensive information about a given query.

### How to create an execution plan

Execution plan is the instruction set for the DB on how to execute a given query, and it holds a valuable information on how the BD will behave and what the impact on the DB will be.

In order to generate an execution plan from a query, you need to run your query with the EXPLAIN command before the query.

Add the following line of code before running the query:

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, COSTS, VERBOSE, BUFFERS, TIMING, FORMAT JSON)
```

For example:

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, COSTS, VERBOSE, BUFFERS, TIMING, FORMAT JSON)
select *
from postgres_air.flight
where flight_id = 108340
```

The result will be an execution plan, in a JSON format which we will copy to the Query analyzer.

After inserting a query and its execution plan the Query analyzer will look like this:

After clicking on ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù you will get an analyzed query result with insights

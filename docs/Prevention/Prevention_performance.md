# ðŸš¨ Prevent performance related problems

Metis allows you to view the SQL commands running in your environments, gain insights into performance and potential errors, and determine the safety of deploying changes to production.

## Workflow

**Step 1:** Instrument your app to send the traces to an [Open Telemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/). 

**Step 2:** Deploy Metis Collector. It generates Execution Plans of the SQL commands and send them to Metis platform. 

**Step 3:** Open Metis web app to view the monitored activity and insights. 

- View the root of the distributed traces, usually REST commands, generated by your application
- View the SQL commands created in each trace
- View the execution plan and insights
